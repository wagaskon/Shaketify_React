# Overview:
An earthquake is a natural disaster caused by the sudden release of energy in the earth's crust, which creates seismic waves that can result in ground shaking, damage to infrastructure and buildings, and even loss of life. Predicting future earthquake anywhere in the world is impossible but when it occurred the USGS (United States Geological Survey) readily record it and provide all information about it. Earthquake shakes moves through earth crust in form of waves. This gives us a few minutes to alerts people who havenâ€™t felt the earthquake yet. So, we can alert people about the earthquake that is on way toward them.
"Shaketify" is a web-based disaster alert system designed to provide alerts to the public that are few miles far away from the epicenter. The system is built on Google technologies and utilizes seismic activity data to provide early warning and response to earthquakes. The primary goal of "Shaketify" is to enhance disaster preparedness and reduce the impact of earthquakes on communities. The app focuses on earthquake alerts, but can be expanded in the future to cover other types of disasters.
